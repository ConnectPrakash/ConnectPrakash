1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
    HTTP/1.1: The Classic Protocol
    HTTP/1.1 has been the most widely used version of HTTP for many years.
    It uses a request-response model, where a client sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested data. 

    HTTP/2: The Next Generation
    HTTP/2, released in 2015, aims to address the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and provide improved performance and efficiency.
    Let's explore the key features of HTTP/2:
2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
   object:   
          In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs,
    where the keys are strings (or symbols in ES6+) and the values can be any data type, including other objects.
    Objects in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning they can have properties and methods added, modified, or removed at runtime.

Internal Representation of Objects:
           Internally, objects in JavaScript are implemented as dictionaries or hash tables. 
     This representation allows for efficient property access and dynamic property addition or removal.
     Each object has a hidden property called the internal prototype, which references another object or null. 
     This internal prototype forms the basis of JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance.
